The goal of this assignment was to create a employee database that allows for users to make changes to the department, roles and employees. One should be able to make changes to these functions throught the terminal. 

This is the user story

This is the acceptance criteria

For this assignment I have used chatGBT in order to help me structure the starter code, however I have struggled with getting the code to be pulled up into insomnia to check for bugs and connection issues.
